    "#### 1.2 Project Purpose & Objectives (\"Manifesto\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has largely drawn inspirations from Doctor Carl Skelton's work <i><a href = \"https://uttri.utoronto.ca/files/2019/05/CitizenInformaticsCleaned01reduced.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Citizen Informatics: Integrating Urban Data and Design for Future Stakeholders</a></i>. The project is developed with the aim that big data—especially real-time data points pertaining to descriptive features related to urban planning—should not only be made **publicly available**, but also **easily accessible, manipulable, and operable** by any citizens as direct and active participants to urban planning in the *planning* stage (e.g. as proposers of policies/models, independent evaluators of existing proposals, operators of big data for statistical inferences, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "It further concurs with the nascent notion that *literacy* shall be redefined to include *data literacy* in our era of big-data and digitalization, and that *standards of literacy* are not only those *crude and passive*, but rather must also include the ability, of the literate population, to **make sense of, manipulate, and thereby create new content using existing information**. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on **modeling the traffic network patterns of the City of New York**, due to considerations that traffic networks largely define modern physical mobility, a characteristic essential to models in the social sciences ranging from economic analyses to urban planning (optimizing citizen life quality/living experience). Furthermore, citizens/residents of the City of New York are already automatically (and oftentimes unwittingly) *passive participants in the city's traffic network*. It is meaningful and rightfully pertaining to civil duties that they may be empowered with the *easily accessible, manipulable, and operable* big data information so that they may become *active and literate participants* in the planning of the traffic network of the City.\n",
    "\n",
    "With regards to the **public availability of open data**, the City of New York shall be recognized and commended for its easily accessible <i><a href = \"https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/\" target = \"_blank\">public open data database</a></i>. Nonetheless, for instance, its <i><a href = \"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Real-Time-Traffic-Speed-Data/qkm5-nuaq\" target = \"_blank\">Real-Time Traffic Speed Data</a></i> provided by the NYCDOT (<i><a href = \"http://nyctmc.org/ \" target = \"_blank\">New York City Department of Transportation</a></i>) is **NOT easily accessible, manipulable, and operable at all**. A simple glance over the dataset can reveal that it is poorly organized (left in a tabular form, without even any descriptive statistics), presented in string (and thus non-machine-readable nor -analyzable) formats, and without informative and visual illustrations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, with the broader objective of **supporting, informing, and encouraging broad public participation in urban (traffic) planning**, the developer of this project has developed a functioning prototype of a **descriptive and predictive simulator of NYC traffic network patterns that permits interactive user specifications (the exact functions to be specified in section 1.3 below)**. Of course, due to the limited scope of this project, the end-product is more of an **artistic and illustrative prototype**, and **shall NOT be used as a model from which extrapolating inferences or generalizations can be made to the real world**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will, nonetheless, call on and invite scholars and experts in the relevant fields, to pay attention and efforts to **figuratively constructing the bridge that is necessary to connect public datasets (in non-user-friendly formats) with end-users (who may not necessarily have great skills or expertise in data science, statistical inferences and modeling, or relevant fields), thereby fostering broad public participation in urban (traffic) planning—with minimum assumptions/skill requirements, but rather maximum inclusion of the end-users as modern citizens in urban settings**."

This is largely due to considerations of compatibility of the computing power of different devices and operating systems—**1,000 data points would still be statistically large enough** (for theorems such as the *Law of Large Numbers* or *Central Limit Theorem* to hold—which validates the unbiasedness and consistency of the inferences of the models), while **not so large that the server queries place significant burdens on the devices of end-users** (or the queries may simply take too much time and negatively impact user experiences). \n",

Thus, the sample being studied in this simulator (and its relevant models) **may not necessarily be representative of the behavioral variations of traffic network patterns within boroughs across time in its entirity**—due to practical considerations and the limited scope of this project—thus **statistical inferences with real-world implications should NOT be drawn from this simulator, as consistently mentioned above**.
