## Comments from the Professor
- What if an additional tunnel from NYC -> NJ or else where is added in addition to Manhattan grid (boats & horses)
- check if open data includes those traffic feeds
- ARC tunnel (proposal to add another tunnel from New Jersey to Manhattan, into Penn Station)
- A 3rd or 4th track ++ AmTrack rails (DC <-> Boston)
- Mass transit (rather than cars) into the Island
- open data about train capacities / differentiate between cars and buses [description of `open data`]

- Policy Proposal (infrastructure: Boston - NY - DC transit corridor) trains ~ mass transit (grand central ~ 1990s)
- Does the Raw Data exist (how much, simulation possible? ~policy decisions abt what capacities could be developed next)

- Robert Moses ~ 50s - Lincoln Tunnel - Flyway (over Manhattan)
- how much of the traffic `wants` to be in Manhattan at all (NJ to Brooklyn)
- Mapping the holes in the database

- MTA being broke
- what info you DO and DONOT have
- the answer that can be built from available information (simulation)
- assets that would have been necessary

- what available assets will permit, pick one and do it

- render/represent the places/streets/traffic tunnels that we DO NOT have data
- allowing for blanks
- what data I don't have but should have, crude representation.
- data: not real time, but get it by day/statistic (historical) - Amtrak/MTA
- passgener vs. price

- annual stat: project average day rate (AVERAGE)
- Robert Moses: arterial road (regional transportation system: all motor vehicles)
- availability, resolution (congestion pricing - rationale for that)
- projections on traffic: extra toll

- who will be able to afford to drive around Manhattan.
- does the information exist (for a member of the public to make informed
- decisions/comments/alternative proposals for policies: resident participation in policy making)
